# haskell_learning

In this repo I will put my Haskell learning path as well as links of talks and things that I listen to and find interesting.

A good way to go is reading the book Learn you a Haskell (http://learnyouahaskell.com/) while doing, chapter after chapter, the exercices described by noelmarkham in https://github.com/noelmarkham/learn-you-a-haskell-exercises.
