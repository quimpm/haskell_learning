# Learning Haskell Path

!(https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/raw/master/src/common/images/icon48.png)

In this repo I will put my Haskell learning path as well as links of talks and things that I listen to and find interesting.

A good way to go is reading the book [Learn you a Haskell](http://learnyouahaskell.com/) while doing, chapter after chapter, the exercices described by noelmarkham in [learn-you-a-haskell-exercices](https://github.com/noelmarkham/learn-you-a-haskell-exercises).

Also when I finish LYAH I will start with a course on advanced functional programming that a teacher recomended to me. The course is [Advanced Functional Programing](http://www.cs.nott.ac.uk/~pszgmh/afp.html) made by [Graham Hutton](http://www.cs.nott.ac.uk/~pszgmh/)
